Fe/Mn Diabetes Research
Overview
This research focuses on investigating the relationship between mineral ratios, specifically the iron-to-manganese (Fe/Mn) ratio, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The study explores how imbalances in mineral homeostasis may influence metabolic health through alterations in the microbial ecology.

Key Hypothesis
Elevated iron-to-manganese ratios promote the dominance of iron-dependent fungal microbiota, which may contribute to metabolic dysregulation such as diabetes.

In other words:

Diabetes is associated with a high Fe/Mn ratio combined with an iron-dependent fungal microbiota dominance.

This hypothesis suggests a causal pathway linking mineral imbalance and microbial dysbiosis to the pathogenesis of T2D.

Research Approach
Data Analysis:
Utilizing NHANES 2017â€“2018 dataset to quantify Fe/Mn ratios and diabetes prevalence, demonstrating a strong positive exponential correlation.

Microbial Ecology:
Investigating fungal microbiota profiles that depend on iron availability, hypothesized to proliferate under elevated Fe/Mn conditions, potentially affecting host metabolism.

Multivariate Modeling:
Considering additional mineral ratios such as Cu/Zn to understand the combined influence on diabetes risk.

Visualization:
Employing 2D and 3D risk surface plots to depict the joint effects of Fe/Mn and Cu/Zn ratios.

Implications
This study proposes a unified mineral-microbiota axis as a potential mechanistic driver of T2D, offering new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

The iron-dependent fungal microbiota may serve as an early warning or intervention point, complementing established metabolic and genetic risk factors.

Future Directions
Experimental validation using animal models and human cohorts.

Development of diagnostic tools measuring mineral ratios and fungal markers.

Clinical trials exploring mineral modulation and antifungal therapies for diabetes prevention and treatment.
